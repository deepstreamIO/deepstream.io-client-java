@events
Feature: Events Misc
	This feature covers other possible scenarios that can occur, such as
	attempting to unsubscribe to an event that you haven't subscribed to.

Scenario: The client attempts to subscribe to the same event multiple times
	only triggers a single subscribe message to the server and the
	incoming events should be multiplexed on the client

	# User logs in
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

	# User subscribes multiple time to same event
	Given the server resets its message count
	When the client subscribes to an event named "test2"
		And the server sends the message E|A|S|test2+
		And the client subscribes to an event named "test2"
	Then the server received the message E|S|test2+
		And the server has received 1 messages

#TODO: This does not clear the timeout, which means the following test throws an error
#Scenario: The client tries to unsubscribe from an event it wasn't previously subscribed to
#	When the client unsubscribes from an event named "test3"
#		And the server sends the message E|E|NOT_SUBSCRIBED|test3+
#	Then the client throws a "NOT_SUBSCRIBED" error with message "test3"

#TODO Eventhandler needs to pass the client to convert typed
#Scenario: The client receives a message with typed data, but an unknown type
	#When the server sends the message E|EVT|someEvent|QXX+
	#Then the client throws a MESSAGE_PARSE_ERROR error with message Unknown type XXX
