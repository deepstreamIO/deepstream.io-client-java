@rpc @timeout
Feature: RPC Timeouts
	Remote Procedure Calls are deepstream's
	concept of request-response communication.
	This requires a client that makes the RPC
	(requestor or receiver) and another client
	that answers it (provider).

	Whenever a provide or unprovide event does not
	recieve an acknolowdgement from the server the
	client should emit an ack timeout error so
	that the client can attempt to retry.

Scenario: RPC Timeouts
	# The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

# Making

	# The client makes an RPC
	When the client requests RPC "toUppercase" with data "abc"
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

	# The client receives a timeout
	When some time passes
	Then the client recieves an error RPC callback for "toUppercase" with the message "RESPONSE_TIMEOUT"

# Providing

	# The client provides a RPC
	When the client provides a RPC called "toUppercase"
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|S|toUppercase+

	# The server does not respond in time with a subscribe ACK
	When some time passes
	Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "No ACK message received in time for SUBSCRIBE toUppercase"

# Unproviding

	# The client stops providing a RPC
	When the client stops providing a RPC called "toUppercase"
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|US|toUppercase+

	# The server does not respond in time with an unsubscribe ACK
	When some time passes
	Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "No ACK message received in time for UNSUBSCRIBE toUppercase"
