Feature: Event Listen
  Listening to Event subscriptions/unsubscriptions allows the client
  to reduce the events it needs to publish. If a client subscribes
  to an event that matches your pattern or when all the clients
  unsubscribe you'll be told so you can only publish events that you
  know are being listened to.

  Scenario: The client is connected
    Given the test server is ready
    And the client is initialised
    And the server sends the message C|A+
    And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    And the server sends the message A|A+

  #Scenario: The client listens to eventPrefix
    When the client listens to events matching "eventPrefix/.*"
    Then the last message the server recieved is E|L|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The server responds with a listen ACK
    Given the server sends the message E|A|L|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The client gets notified of new matching subscriptions
    Given the server sends the message E|SP|eventPrefix/.*|eventPrefix/foundAMatch+
    Then the client will be notified of new event match "eventPrefix/foundAMatch"

  #Scenario: The client gets notified for removed subscriptions
    Given the server sends the message E|SR|eventPrefix/.*|eventPrefix/foundAMatch+
    Then the client will be notified of event match removal "eventPrefix/foundAMatch"

  #Scenario: The client unlistens to eventPrefix
    When the client unlistens to events matching "eventPrefix/.*"
    Then the last message the server recieved is E|UL|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The server responds with a unlisten ACK
    Given the server sends the message E|A|UL|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: Following server updates will throw an error
    #Given the server sends the message E|SP|eventPrefix/.*|eventPrefix/foundAMatch+
    #And the client throws a "UNSOLICITED_MESSAGE" error with message "eventPrefix/.*"
