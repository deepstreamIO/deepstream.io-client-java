Feature: Events Connectivity
  Events subscriptions must be resent to the server after connection
  issues to guarantee it continues recieving them correctly. This
  applies to both subscribing to events and listening to event
  subscriptions.

  Scenario: The client is connected
    Given the test server is ready
    And the client is initialised
    And the server sends the message C|A+
    And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    And the server sends the message A|A+

  #Scenario: The client subscribes to an event
    Given the client subscribes to an event named "test1"
    Then the last message the server recieved is E|S|test1+

  #Scenario: The server sends an ACK message for test1
    Given the server sends the message E|A|S|test1+

  #Scenario: The client listens to eventPrefix
    When the client listens to events matching "eventPrefix/.*"
    Then the last message the server recieved is E|L|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The server sends an ACK message for eventPrefix
    Given the server sends the message E|A|L|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The client loses its connection to the server
    #When the connection to the server is lost
    #Given two seconds later
    #Then the client throws a "connectionError" error with message "Can't connect! Deepstream server unreachable on localhost:7777"
    #And the clients connection state is "RECONNECTING"

  #Scenario: The client publishes an event
    #When the client publishes an event named "test1" with data "yetAnotherValue"
    #Then the server did not recieve any messages

  #Scenario: The client reconnects to the server
    #When the connection to the server is reestablished
    #And the server sends the message C|A+
    #Then the clients connection state is "AUTHENTICATING"

  #Scenario: The client successfully reconnects
    #Given the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    #And the server sends the message A|A+
    #Then the clients connection state is "OPEN"

  #Scenario: The client resends the event subscription
    #Then the server received the message E|S|test1+

  #Scenario: The client resends the event listen
    #Then the server received the message E|L|eventPrefix/.*+

  #Scenario: The client sends offline events
    #Then the server received the message E|EVT|test1|SyetAnotherValue+
