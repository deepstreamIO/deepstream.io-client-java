Feature: Record Subscription
	Record subscriptions is done purely on the
	client side. Whenever an update is recieved
	for a record, you should find out if anyone is
	interested and then notify them. When
	implementing, please keep in mind the
	difference between an update and a patch.

	Updates mean you should fully discard the data
	that you had, and replace it with the data
	recieved.

	Patch means you should apply the diff onto the
	data you currently have.

	From the clients callback perspective there
	isn't really a difference when recieving
	updates or patches, since the new data is
	compared against the old and only the
	differences are provided to the callback

Scenario: Record Subscription
	# The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

	# The client creates a record
	When the client creates a record named "subscribeRecord"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|CR|subscribeRecord+

	# The server responds with an ack and the initial read
	When the server sends the message R|A|S|subscribeRecord+
		And the server sends the message R|R|subscribeRecord|124|{"name":"Smith","pets":[{"name":"Ruffus","type":"dog","age":0}]}+

# Full Subscribe

	# The client subscribes to subscribeRecord
	When the client subscribes to the entire record "subscribeRecord" changes
	Then the client will not be notified of the record change

	# The client record subscribeRecord receives updated data it will notify subscribers
	When the server sends the message R|U|subscribeRecord|125|{"name":"Smith","pets":[{"name":"Ruffus","type":"dog","age":1}]}+
	Then the client will be notified of the record change

	# The client record subscribeRecord receives partial data it will notify subscribers
	When the server sends the message R|P|subscribeRecord|126|pets[0].name|SRuffusTheSecond+
	Then the client will be notified of the partial record change

	# The client will no longer get notified after it unsubscribes
	Given the client unsubscribes to the entire record "subscribeRecord" changes
	When the server sends the message R|U|subscribeRecord|127|{"name":"Smith","pets":[{"name":"Ruffus","type":"dog","age":1}]}+
	Then the client will not be notified of the record change

# Path Subscribe

	# The client subscribes subscribeRecord to the path pets.0
	When the client subscribes to "pets[0].age" for the record "subscribeRecord"
	Then the client will not be notified of the record change

	# The client receives an partial update unrelated to the path subscribed to
	When the server sends the message R|P|subscribeRecord|128|name|SJohn Smith+
	Then the client will not be notified of the record change

	# The client receives an full update where the pets age hasn't changed
	When the server sends the message R|U|subscribeRecord|129|{"name":"John Smith", "age": 21, "pets": [{"name":"Ruffus", "type":"dog","age":1}]}+
	Then the client will not be notified of the record change

	# The client receives an partial update related to the path subscribed to
	When the server sends the message R|P|subscribeRecord|130|pets[0].age|N4+
	Then the client will be notified of the record change

	# The client receives an full update where the pets has changed
	When the server sends the message R|U|subscribeRecord|131|{"name":"John Smith", "age": 21, "pets": [{"name":"Ruffus", "type":"dog","age":5}]}+
	Then the client will be notified of the second record change

	# The client will no longer get notified after it unsubscribes to the path
	Given the client unsubscribes to "pets[0].age" for the record "subscribeRecord"
	When the server sends the message R|P|subscribeRecord|132|pets[0].age|N6+
	Then the client will not be notified of the record change
