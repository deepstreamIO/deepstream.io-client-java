Feature: Record Timeouts
	Records have multiple different actions they
	can be made, and each of those actions have
	their own timeouts.

	These timeouts allow you to notify the user if
	an error has occured due to connection issues
	and gives you granular events to allow
	different reactions to different situations.

	The timeouts are:

	ACK_TIMEOUT
		If the user does not recieve a timeout when
		initially requesting a record or discarding
		it.

	RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
		If the user does not recieve the data in a
		timely fashion.

	DELETE_TIMEOUT
		This is when the backend does not respond
		when a record is deleted.

	CACHE_RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT
	STORAGE_RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT
		This is a specific backend issue and does
		not need to be exposed to the user, but
		helps with logging issues.

Scenario: Record Timeouts
	# The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

	# The server does not respond in time with a record ACK
	When the client creates a record named "unhappyRecord"
		And some time passes
	Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "unhappyRecord"

	# The server does not recieve initial record data in time
 	When the server sends the message R|A|S|unhappyRecord+
 		And some time passes
 	# TODO: Should this use another error code?
 	Then the client throws a "RESPONSE_TIMEOUT" error with message "unhappyRecord"

	# The server then recieves the initial record data
	When the server sends the message R|R|unhappyRecord|100|{"reasons":["Because."]}+

	# The client sends an partial update
	When the client sets the record "unhappyRecord" to {"reasons":["Just Because."]}
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|U|unhappyRecord|101|{"reasons":["Just Because."]}+

	# The server send a cache retrieval timeout
 	When the server sends the message R|E|CACHE_RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT|unhappyRecord+
 	Then the client throws a "CACHE_RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT" error with message "unhappyRecord"

	# The server send a storage retrieval timeout
 	When the server sends the message R|E|STORAGE_RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT|unhappyRecord+
 	Then the client throws a "STORAGE_RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT" error with message "unhappyRecord"

	# The client discards record
	When the client discards the record named "unhappyRecord"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|US|unhappyRecord+

	# The server does not respond in time with an unsubscribe ACK
	When some time passes
	Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "unhappyRecord"

	# The client deletes the record
	Given the client creates a record named "unhappyRecord"
		And the server sends the message R|A|S|unhappyRecord+
		And the server sends the message R|R|unhappyRecord|100|{"reasons":["Because."]}+
	When the client deletes the record named "unhappyRecord"
	Then the last message the server recieved is R|D|unhappyRecord+

	# The server does not recieve an ack
	When some time passes
	Then the client throws a "DELETE_TIMEOUT" error with message "unhappyRecord"
