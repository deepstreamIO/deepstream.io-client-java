Feature: RPC Timeouts
  Remote Procedure Calls are deepstream's concept of request-response
  communication. This requires a client that makes the RPC
  (requestor or receiver) and another client that answers it (provider).

  Whenever a provide or unprovide event does not recieve an
  acknolowdgement from the server the client should emit an ack timeout
  error so that the client can attempt to retry.

  Scenario: The client is connected
    Given the test server is ready
    And the client is initialised
    And the server sends the message C|A+
    And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    And the server sends the message A|A+

# Making

  #Scenario: The client makes an RPC
    When the client requests RPC "toUppercase" with data "abc"
    Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

  #Scenario: The client receives a timeout
    #When some time passes
    #Then the client recieves an error RPC callback for "toUppercase" with the message "RESPONSE_TIMEOUT"

# Providing

  #Scenario: The client provides a RPC
    When the client provides a RPC called "toUppercase"
    Then the last message the server recieved is P|S|toUppercase+

  #@timeout
  #Scenario: The server does not respond in time with a subscribe ACK
    #When some time passes
    #Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "No ACK message received in time for toUppercase"

# Unproviding

  #Scenario: The client stops providing a RPC
    When the client stops providing a RPC called "toUppercase"
    Then the last message the server recieved is P|US|toUppercase+

  #@timeout
  #Scenario: The server does not respond in time with an unsubscribe ACK
    #When some time passes
    #Then the client throws a "ACK_TIMEOUT" error with message "No ACK message received in time for
