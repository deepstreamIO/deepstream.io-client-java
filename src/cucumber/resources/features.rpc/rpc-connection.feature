#Feature: RPC Connectivity
  #RPC providers must be resent to the server after connection
  #issuees to guarantee it continues to recieve requests correctly.

  #Scenario: The client is connected
    #Given the test server is ready
    #And the client is initialised
    #And the server sends the message C|A+
    #And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    #And the server sends the message A|A+

  #Scenario: The client provides a RPC
    #When the client provides a RPC called "toUppercase"
    #Then the last message the server recieved is P|S|toUppercase+

  #Scenario: The client gets an ACK
    #When the server sends the message P|A|S|toUppercase+

  #Scenario: The client loses it connection to the server
    #When the connection to the server is lost
    #Given two seconds later
    #And the clients connection state is "RECONNECTING"

  #Scenario: The client reconnects to the server
    #When the connection to the server is reestablished
    #And the server sends the message C|A+
    #Then the clients connection state is "AUTHENTICATING"

  #Scenario: The client successfully reconnects
    #And the server sends the message A|A+
    #Then the clients connection state is "OPEN"
