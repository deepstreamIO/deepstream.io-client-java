Feature: Parsing Messages
	Every message from that's received from the
	server is validated for some basic syntactic
	and semantic criteria

Background:
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

Scenario: The client receives a message with too few parts
	When the server sends the message I only have one part+
	Then the client throws a "MESSAGE_PARSE_ERROR" error with message "Insufficient message parts"

#TODO: This shouldn't pass in its current state
#Scenario: The client receives an empty message
#	When the server sends the message +
#	Then the client throws a MESSAGE_PARSE_ERROR error with message Insufficiant message parts

Scenario: The client receives a message for an unknown topic
	When the server sends the message B|R+
	Then the client throws a "MESSAGE_PARSE_ERROR" error with message "Received message for unknown topic B"

Scenario: The client receives a message with an unknown action
	When the server sends the message R|XXX+
	Then the client throws a "MESSAGE_PARSE_ERROR" error with message "Unknown action XXX"
