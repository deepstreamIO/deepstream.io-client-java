Feature: Logging In
  As soon as the client is initialised, it creates a connection with
  the server. However the connection is initially in a quarantine
  state until it sends an authentication message. The auth message
  (A|REQ|<JSON authData>) must always be the first message send by
  the client.

  Scenario: The client sends login credentials
    Given the test server is ready
    And the client is initialised
    And the server sends the message C|A+
    When the client logs in with username "YYY" and password "XXX"
    Then the last message the server recieved is A|REQ|{"password":"XXX","username":"YYY"}+
    And the clients connection state is "AUTHENTICATING"

  Scenario: The client receives a login confirmation
    Given the test server is ready
    And the client is initialised
    When the server sends the message A|A+
    Then the clients connection state is "OPEN"

  Scenario: The client logs in with an invalid authentication message
    Given the client is initialised
    When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
    But the server sends the message A|E|INVALID_AUTH_MSG|Sinvalid authentication message+
    Then the last login failed with error "INVALID_AUTH_MSG" and message "invalid authentication message"

  #Scenario: The client's authentication data is rejected
    #Given the client is initialised
    #When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "ZZZ"
    #But the server sends the message A|E|INVALID_AUTH_DATA|Sinvalid authentication data+
    #Then the last login failed with error "INVALID_AUTH_DATA" and message "invalid authentication data"

  #Scenario: The client has made too many unsuccessful authentication attempts
    #Given the client is initialised
    #When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "ZZZ"
    #But the server sends the message A|E|TOO_MANY_AUTH_ATTEMPTS|Stoo many authentication attempts+
    #Then the last login failed with error "TOO_MANY_AUTH_ATTEMPTS" and message "too many authentication attempts"

  #Scenario: The client can't made further authentication attempts after it received TOO_MANY_AUTH_ATTEMPTS
    #Given the server resets its message count
    #When the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "ZZZ"
    #Then the server has received 0 messages
    #And the client throws a "IS_CLOSED" error with message "this client's connection was closed"
