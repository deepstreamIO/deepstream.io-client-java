Feature: Requesting an RPC
	Remote Procedure Calls are deepstream's
	concept of request-response communication.
	This requires a client that makes the RPC
	(requestor or receiver) and another client
	that answers it (provider).

	The requestor can make an RPC call and in most
	cases expected a succesful callback.

	However, if something does go wrong, it should
	also expect an error message, which can either
	be system determined such as NO_RPC_PROVIDER
	or an error thrown by the provider itself,
	like when the incorrect arguments are sent.

Scenario: RPC Requestor
	# The client is connected
	Given the test server is ready
		And the client is initialised
		And the server sends the message C|A+
		And the client logs in with username "XXX" and password "YYY"
		And the server sends the message A|A+

# Success

	# The client makes an RPC that will succeed
	When the client requests RPC "toUppercase" with data "abc"
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

	# The client gets a request ACK ( 1 )
	When the server sends the message P|A|toUppercase|<UID>+

	# The client receives a succesful response
	When the server sends the message P|RES|toUppercase|<UID>|SABC+
	Then the client recieves a successful RPC callback for "toUppercase" with data "ABC"

# Error

	# The client makes an RPC that will fail
	When the client requests RPC "toUppercase" with data "abc"
	Then the last message the server recieved is P|REQ|toUppercase|<UID>|Sabc+

	# The client gets a request ACK ( 2 )
	When the server sends the message P|A|toUpperCase|<UID>+

	# The client receives an error response
	When the server sends the message P|E|RPC Error Message|toUppercase|<UID>+
	Then the client recieves an error RPC callback for "toUppercase" with the message "RPC Error Message"
